   - Options to select all or specific categories and seasons.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - View summary statistics and detect missing values.
   - Analyze total and average revenue.
   - Visualize sales trends by category and purchase behavior by gender.

3. **Customer Segment Prediction:**
   - Predict customer segments based on age groups.
   - Visualize segment distribution with a pie chart.

4. **Seasonal Purchase Prediction:**
   - Analyze seasonal trends and forecast future purchasing behavior.
   - Display pivot tables for seasonal sales data.

5. **Consumer Behavior Analysis:**
   - Explore consumer behavior trends across regions.
   - Visualize seasonal sales trends by category for each region.

6. **Responsive Design:**
   - User-friendly interface with sidebar navigation.
   - Dynamic updates based on user selections.

## File Structure
- `app.py`: Main application file containing the Streamlit dashboard code.
- `shopping_trends_with_regions.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.
- `Shoopingtrends.jpg`: Image displayed in the dashboard header.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Dataset
The application uses a CSV file named `shopping_trends_with_regions.csv`. The dataset should contain the following columns:
- `Customer ID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Category`: Product category.
- `Season`: Season of the purchase.
- `Region`: Region of the customer.
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer.
- `Age`: Age of the customer.
- `Item Purchased`: Name of the purchased item.
- `Purchase Amount (USD)`: Amount spent on the purchase.

## How to Use
1. Upload the dataset `shopping_trends_with_regions.csv` to the application.
2. Use the sidebar to navigate between different analyses:
   - Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Customer Segment Prediction
   - Seasonal Purchase Prediction
   - Consumer Behavior Analysis
3. Apply filters for product categories and seasons to refine your analysis.
4. View the interactive visualizations and key insights generated by the application.

## Key Functions
- **EDA:**
  - Displays filtered data and missing value summary.
  - Generates bar charts for sales by category and average purchase by gender.
